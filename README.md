##  getting strted
## Add the start script: Open your package.json file and add the following script under the "scripts" section:

json
Copy code
"start": "nodemon index.js"
Install nodemon globally: In your terminal, run the following command to install nodemon globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g nodemon
Run the application: Start both the frontend and backend servers by running:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the backend server using nodemon and the frontend server using Vite. The backend will be accessible at http://localhost:8080 and the frontend at http://localhost:5173.

## ðŸ”§ Backend Features

The Admin Panel is integrated with a backend to handle employee data efficiently. Below are the key backend features:

### 1. **Employee Data Fetching**
   - The backend serves employee data through API endpoints.
   - Employee details, including name, role, department, and contact information, are fetched and displayed in real-time on the Admin Panel.
   - The data is dynamically updated whenever changes are made.

### 2. **Add New Employee**
   - The backend supports the creation of new employee records.
   - When a new employee is added via the Admin Panel, the backend processes the data and stores it in the database.

### 3. **Edit Employee Information**
   - The backend allows for updating employee details, such as name, position, department, etc.
   - Changes made in the Admin Panel are sent to the backend, where the database is updated accordingly.

### 4. **Delete Employee**
   - Employees can be deleted from the system via the Admin Panel.
   - The backend processes the deletion request and removes the selected employee from the database.

### 5. **API Integration**
   - The backend API is integrated using RESTful principles, allowing the Admin Panel to communicate securely.
   - **GET** requests are made to fetch data, while **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** methods handle creating, updating, and removing employee records.
   
### 6. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - The backend handles authentication with secure username and password validation.
   - Users can log in to the Admin Panel using default credentials or via custom user authentication if needed.

### 7. **Error Handling**
   - The backend provides clear and structured error messages for failed operations, such as invalid data or unsuccessful requests, which are displayed as toast notifications in the Admin Panel.

### Backend Setup (If Applicable)
If you are setting up the backend for this Admin Panel, follow these steps to integrate and configure your backend API:

1. **Clone or Set up your Backend Server**:
   - Ensure your backend server is up and running.
   - The backend should have API routes for handling employee data (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).

2. **Update `.env` with Backend API URL**:
   - Set the correct backend API URL in the `.env` file:
     ```bash
     VITE_API_URL=http://your-backend-api-url.com
     ```

3. **Verify the Backend Integration**:
   - Once the backend is set up and running, ensure that the Admin Panel is properly fetching data from the backend.
   - Test the **Add**, **Edit**, and **Delete** employee features to ensure they are correctly interacting with the backend.

This section describes the backend functionalities that power the Admin Panel. Ensure that the backend is properly configured for smooth communication and data handling between the frontend and backend.
